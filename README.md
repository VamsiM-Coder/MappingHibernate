🔗 Hibernate SQL Relationship Mapping Overview
In this project, we use Hibernate ORM to map Java entities to a MySQL relational database using various types of relationships. These mappings follow standard JPA annotations to define how entities relate to each other. Here's a summary of the key relationship types used:

🧍‍♂️ One-to-One (@OneToOne)
Represents a one-to-one relationship between two entities.

Each row in one table corresponds to exactly one row in another table.

Typically used for entities that share the same lifecycle (e.g., User ↔ UserProfile).

java
Copy
Edit
@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "profile_id")
private UserProfile profile;
✅ Use Case: A User has exactly one UserProfile.

👨‍👩‍👧 One-to-Many (@OneToMany) & Many-to-One (@ManyToOne)
Represents a parent-child relationship where one entity is related to many others.

In database terms, the "many" side has a foreign key to the "one" side.

Annotated on the parent side with @OneToMany and on the child side with @ManyToOne.

java
Copy
Edit
// Parent side (e.g., User.java)
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "user")
private List<Repository> repositories;

// Child side (e.g., Repository.java)
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "user_id")
private User user;
✅ Use Case: A User can own multiple Repositories.

🔁 Many-to-Many (@ManyToMany)
Represents a relationship where many entities can be related to many others.

Requires a join table in the database to manage the association.

Bidirectional or unidirectional mapping supported.

java
Copy
Edit
@ManyToMany
@JoinTable(
name = "repository_stars",
joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "repository_id"),
inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "user_id")
)
private List<User> stargazers;
✅ Use Case: A Repository can be starred by many Users, and a User can star many Repositories.

Relation Type	Annotation	DB Implementation	Example
One-to-One	@OneToOne	Foreign Key	User ↔ UserProfile
One-to-Many	@OneToMany	Foreign Key (on Many)	User → Repositories
Many-to-One	@ManyToOne	Foreign Key (on Many)	Repository → User
Many-to-Many	@ManyToMany	Join Table	Repository ↔ Stargazers (Users)
